# Frequency Separation


### Example 1:

1. Duplicate your Background layer twice: the top layer is the base for the high frequency image data and the bottom duplicate is for the low frequency image data.
2. Turn off the visibility of the High Frequency layer and select the Low Frequency layer.
3. With the Low Frequency layer selected, run the Gaussian Blur filter and choose Pixel Radius with which all the fine details will be blurred. We turn off the visibility of the High Frequency layer, so that we can better see how our choice of Pixel Radius affects the entire image. After you've applied the Gaussian Blur filter, turn the High Frequency layer's visibility back on.
4. Now select the High Frequency layer and go Image > Apply Image and depending on what color depth you're working in your settings will be as follows (click to enlarge):
5. Now change the Blending Mode of the High Frequency layer to Linear Light and your overall image will look exactly as before you started the separation.
